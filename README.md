In this tutorial, I demonstrate how to retrieve and render data from a database onto an HTML page using Flask and SQLAlchemy. Learn how to:
- Fetch data from a SQLite database with SQLAlchemy.
- Pass data from Flask to the front-end using Jinja2 templating.
- Display dynamic content on your web pages directly from the database.
- Build a fully interactive web application with Flask.

This is a crucial step for anyone looking to build dynamic web pages in Flask.
